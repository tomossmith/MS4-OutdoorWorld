## <span id="ux-design"><b>Design</b></span>

* ### <span id="ux-design-color"><b>Color</b></span>

    When choosing the most suitable color scheme for the site, I decided to list the main points of what I wanted to try to create from the design.

    Here are the key points to consider when choosing the colors:

    * Eye Catching
    * Comfortable
    * Color Compatibility
    * Use colors commonly associated with Adventure/Outdoor Activities

    I chose to develop both the logo and the main site theme at the same time to ensure that they could work well together. 
    The colors were going to be an important part of the design in order to create a brand that could be applied throughout the company should it be required in the future.

    To choose a compatible color scheme, I decided to use [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) to find colors that would work well together. 
    I began by searching the [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) site using keywords such as Outdoor, Mountains, Climing, Scrambling and Hiking. The site then found a large selection of different color schemes, and I chose a color scheme I felt would represent the brand for the site well.
    
    [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) also helps ensure that the colors are compatible together.

* ### <span id="ux-design-typography"><b>Typography</b></span>

    When choosing which font to use as part of my design, I felt it was important for it to be easy to read but less uniform than fonts commonly found on other sites. I wanted the font to be appropriate so that I could use it for the logo text and the main site text. This would then help maintain a nice continuity within the design and help create the store's brand.

    I have used Google to source the fonts and these are loaded within the head of the page.

    The logo font is [Sedwick Ave](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sedgwick+Ave?preview.text=Outdoor%20World&preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles)

    <img src="" alt="Image of the Sedwick Ave Font" width="30%">

    This is the font @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

    The secondary font is [@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@](https://@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@)

    <img src="" alt="Image of the @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Font" width="30%">

    This font is used as the font for all key information of the product descriptions and checkout information etc. making sure the large blocks of text are easy to read.





























* ### <span id="ux-design-images"><b>Images</b></span>

    There is very little base images on the site, but does display a large amount of images based on the content uploads of the end user.
    The images for each of the recipes posted to the site are outsourced and the user must provide a url to the image of their recipe when uploading it to the site.
    These uploads then form the design of all the pages.

<br>

* ### <span id="ux-design-amendments"><b>Amendments To Mockup Designs During Development</b></span>

    During the development there were very minor changes to the original design I created. I had originally planned to have a landing page to welcome users to the site with a button that they could click to open the recipe book. However, when I built this, it felt that having this feature increased the time it took for the end user to reach the purpose of the site. I made the decision to remove the opening page and direct users straight into the recipe book.

## <span id="features"><b>Features</b></span>

* ### <span id="features-current"><b>Current Features</b></span>

    * #### <b>User Access Structure</b>

        In order to manage the recipe uploads, the site needed to be able to restrict certain users from being able to carry out certain tasks on the site.
        Tasks such as:
            - A user <b>MUST</b> be registered and logged in to the site to upload a recipe.
            - A user <b>MUST</b> be logged in and the owner of the uploaded recipe to edit or remove the recipe.
            - The necessary user access requirements <b>MUST</b> be checked upon landing on every restricted site, even if the user enters the direct URL.

        In order to achieve this, all the restricted access sites have functions at the top of the site that will check if the user meets the necessary requirements. If they do, the content will load. If not, an error message will be displayed.

    * #### <b>Navigation Menu Based On User Level</b>

        <img src="readme-images/wireframe-user-access.png" alt="Wireframe image for the navigation bars based on user access." width="100%">

        There are additional items placed within the navigation menu that are only displayed depending on the user's log in state.
        I felt it was important that a user that is not logged in, shouldn't need to see the 'new recipe' button. The same would also apply for a user that is logged in that shouldn't see all the navigation options that an administrator would see.

        To overcome these issues, there are if statements within the navigation menu code that checks the state of the user and displays the relevant options based on the result.

    * #### <b>Dynamically Created Navigation Menu Dropdown</b>

        Administrators of the site can edit the different recipe categories.
        These categories are then listed as options within a dropdown in the navigation menu so that the site user can see all the recipes that are uploaded to the site based on the category they choose.

        When an administrator adds/removes a category from the site, the navigation item 'categories' will automatically update to show the changes made by the administrator.

    * #### <b>Read Only Access To Recipes For Unregistered Users</b>

        It was important that first time visitors to the site were able to see what the site was all about. The site will display all of the uploaded content to the un-registered user, however the un-registered user will not have access to add, edit, remove recipes but does have access to login or register for an account at anytime.

    * #### <b>User Account</b>

        In order to manage how the recipes were managed, the site has a user account system. Users can create an account with the website that will allow them to log in and extend the functionality of the site.

    * #### <b>User's Recipe Collection & Management Page</b>

        I felt it was important for a user to be able to manage their uploads in a quick and easy way and to do this, I created a user recipe page.
        When a user successfully logs in, they will be re-directed to a page that displays all the recipes they have uploaded.
        From here they have the option to open, edit or delete any of the displayed recipes.
        They can also visit this page by clicking the {{username}}'s Recipes link within the navigation bar. This link will automatically update to display the session user's username for a more personal interaction with the site.

    * #### <b>Administrator Account</b>

        To manage the site, I created an administrator account. This account provides the user with all privileges to manage the website.

        The administrator can:
            - create or remove additional recipe categories

* ### <span id="features-future"><b>Possible Future Features</b></span>

    * #### Video Demonstrations / Live Cooking Sessions
        Now that more and more users are using the internet to learn, it would be great to offer the site users some live and pre-recorded cooking events. Users will be able to watch a live or recorded video of top chefs preparing some of the recipes from the site. This could be a feature that could become part of a paid subscription, this then earing revenue to the site.

    * #### Cookery Equipment Store
        The internet is quickly becoming a tool to promote and advertise products to their customers. By offering a cookery equipment store as part of the site, it is likely that the audience of the site already has a large interest in cooking and therefore the target audience for selling cooking products is already at the site.

        Recipes could include links to equipment best used to cook the recipe, offering the user the opportunity to buy the equipment directly from the site. This also helps create an 'all in one' portal for all things cooking!

    * #### Order Recipe Ingredients
        Very similar to the cook shop, offering the customers a quick and easy solution to buy all the necessary ingredients for the recipe would be a great feature for those who want a quick an easy solution to producing these foods themselves at home, and would also offer another revenue generating opportunity to the site.

        The recipes could have a button at the bottom that users could click to buy the exact ingredients listed within the recipe.

    * #### Recipe Ratings
        It would be a great feature to allow registered users to give a rating on recipes that they have tried. 
        This would increase the social interaction on the site, and may be an additional feature to help users decide which recipe to cook next.

## <span id="database"><b>Database</b></span>

As part of my planning process, I felt it was important to work out what fields I would need to use and share as part of the site.

## <span id="testing"><b>Testing</b></span>

* ### <span id="testing-html"><b>HTML</b></span>

    To test my HTML code, I used the [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

    A common problem that kept appearing in the validation was the error relating to the multiple uses of the same id's. 
    When writing some of the for loops, it never occurred to me that by using the ID within the loop, it would be repeating itself multiple times on the published page. I quickly resolved these issues by changing the ID's to class rules. Once I made these changes, all of the pages passed the validation check.

    Here is the pass report for the homepage:

    <img src="readme-images/html_validation_report.png" alt="HTML Validation Report" width="80%">

<br>

* ### <span id="testing-css"><b>CSS</b></span>

    To test my CSS code, I used the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

    When I first ran the validator, it returned the following errors:

    <img src="readme-images/css_errors.png" alt="CSS Validator Error Report" width="80%">

    The first error was simply a typing error and once the ',' was removed the error was cleared.

    The next two errors were due to the sizes I had entered as the parameters for the media queries. I had entered the dimensions incorrectly, setting a parameter of 319px instead of 320px for example. I had also generated 2 media queries to cover 2 screen dimensions, I then realised I could achieve the desired results with a much simpler query, setting the page logo to a smaller size for screen widths of less than 768px.

    Once I made the changes above, the errors were then cleared. However, there are 3 remaining warnings within the CSS validation, these errors related to external style sheets as part of the Materialize style sheets and extensions.

    Here is the pass report:

    <img src="readme-images/css_pass.png" alt="CSS Validator Report" width="80%">

<br>

* ### <span id="testing-javascript"><b>Javascript</b></span>

    To test my Javascript code, I used the [JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/)

    The initial report showed that I had an instance that was no longer being used, to correct this error I removed this instance.

    Further errors were listed (as shown below) that related to the validator reporting that each '$' was an undefined variable.
    I believe this is an issue within the validator itself. It is trying to determine that the '$' is a variable in itself.
    I therefore ignored these errors as the functions would not work correctly without the '$'.

    <img src="readme-images/js_error_report.png" alt="JSHint Validator Report" width="80%">

<br>

* ### <span id="testing-pep8"><b>PEP8 Compliance</b></span>

    To test my PEP8 compliance, I used [PEP8 Online Check](http://pep8online.com).

    Here were the results:

    <img src="readme-images/pep8_report.png" alt="PEP8 Report" width="80%">

<br>

* ### <span id="testing-lighthouse"><b>Overall Website Performance & Compatibility</b></span>

    To test my websites performance and compatibility, I used [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)

    The initial lighthouse report showed that there was a significant issue with the accessibility score that related to the choice of colors that were used for the site.

    There were areas of the site that did not meet the color contrast requirement of the site. A poor contrast between colors can often be difficult and uncomfortable for users to see. To help improve this score and to ensure the site is easy to read, I altered some of the poorly contrasting colors and made sure that any background colors work well with the foreground colors.

    Once I rectified this issue, I ran the tests again and the results showed a poor rating for the performance. 

    <img src="readme-images/lighthouse_error_report.png" alt="Lighthouse Error Report" width="80%">

    These errors were due to load times for the images being used for the recipes on the site, as these are external URL's to images then I have no control of the size or format of image that the user has uploaded. I researched what options were available to deal with images being loaded from URL's and the only solution I found was to include '?tr=q-10' at the end of the image URL's. This reduces the quality of the image to 20% when loading.  This increased my performance score from 70 to 73.

    There was also a drop in the SEO score after adding the pagination feature to the site. The report recognised the pagination links as 'href' and has a requirement for formatting these in order to make the links crawlable for search engines. As this is generated automatically, I was not able to improve this score.

    <img src="readme-images/lighthouse_report.png" alt="Lighthouse Report" width="80%">

    In the future I would like to include the possibility for users to upload and store the images onto the website's server, this will help manage file sizes, and types in order to improve load times.

<br>

* ### <span id="testing-responsive-design"><b>Responsive Design</b></span>

    In order to maintain a good responsive design for the site, I tried to use the Materialize CSS classes for the most of the design.
    This helped generate suitable layouts for the recipes that adapt automatically if the display dimensions change.
    Using the Materialize classes also helped reduce the number of media queries that had to be written, this keeping the amount of CSS code to a minimum.

    In order to test the design on as many devices as possible, I came across a website called [Responsive Test Tool](http://responsivetesttool.com/)
    It enabled me to test my design on a large range of devices.

* ### <span id="testing-browser-compatibility"><b>Browser Compatibility</b></span>

    To test my site's compatibility, I found a website called [Browserling](https://www.browserling.com/)

    Using this tool I was able to test a range of browsers, some of which I wouldn't otherwise have access to.
    Unfortunately the site has a limited free version, and an upgrade to a premium plan would be required to access every device they offer, however I'm confident that the site is very compatible on the most popular browsers.

    <img src="readme-images/browser_chrome.png" alt="chrome browser test" width="40%">
    <img src="readme-images/browser_firefox.png" alt="firefox browser test" width="40%">
    <img src="readme-images/browser_ie.png" alt="internet explorer browser test" width="40%">
    <img src="readme-images/browser_opera.png" alt="opera browser test" width="40%">

* ### <span id="testing-links"><b>Link Testing</b></span>

    In my last project, I tested all the website links manually by navigating the site myself. The problem I found was that there were links that I had forgotten about which meant there were many left unchecked.
    For this project I've found an online tool called [Dead Link Checker](https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/) which scans the whole site for links and tests to make sure they are all correct. This has worked great and provided a detail report on its results. However, I felt it was important that not only were the links complete, but that they are directing the users to the correct places. 
    As this is not a test that the online tool can carry out, I browsed the site and followed the links to make sure they were opening the correct sites.

    Here are the results from the [Dead Link Checker](https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/):

    <img src="readme-images/broken_link_report.png" alt="Dead Link Reports" width="80%">

* ### <span id="testing-user-stories"><b>User Story Testing</b></span>

    * <b>User Experience</b>

        - When I visit the site, I want to know that I have landed on the correct site that I intended to visit.

            When users arrive at the site, there is a clear and bold logo visible straight away. 
            This is followed by a large title of 'recipe book' followed by some recently uploaded recipes.

            I believe this is a suitable opening site that allows the users to quickly know they have arrived at the correct page.

            <img src="readme-images/testing-ue1.png" alt="Foodie Homepage" width="80%">

        - I need to be able to navigate to the key elements of the site quickly.

            Like many sites, the navigation bar can be found at the traditional location on the page at the top right.
            I think this makes it easy for the user to know where to go to find the navigation bar and locate the links to the key elements of the site.

            <img src="readme-images/testing-ue2.png" alt="Foodie Homepage" width="80%">

        - The website should load correctly on any device.

            I have carried out testing on the site on different devices using both virtual devices and on devices that I own.
            By using the materialize classes, I feel the website performs well on a large range of popular devices.

            <img src="readme-images/testing-ue3.png" alt="Foodie Homepage" width="80%">

        - The website should load quickly and only load the necessary files required to display the key elements of the site first to improve load times.

            This was an area that was a little tricky to deal with, however I was able to make minor changes to help improve load times.
            Unfortunately, as the website was sourcing the recipe images using URL's provided by the site users, this meant that there were increased load times.
            To help improve these times I changed the number of recipes that were being displayed on the homepage using pagination and also deferred some scripts and links from loading at the initial load of the page.

        - Site visitors should be able to find social links to engage and share recipes to friends through their social media connections.

            The internet is strongly used for social networking and users will often share with friend's websites that they discover. To help attract more users to the site, social links are important platforms for users to engage and share with, in turn bringing more users to the site.

            The social links for Foodie are located within the footer of every page, and I have used the easily recognize logos for each social site to make the presentation of this part of the site more appealing to users.

            <img src="readme-images/testing-ue5.png" alt="social icons in the footer" width="80%">


    * <b>First Time Visitor Goals</b>

        - First Time Visitors, should be able to understand the purpose and reason for the site.

            As soon as the user lands on the site, they are presented with a minimal looking site, with a logo that stands out and gives the instant impression of a website associated with food. Without having to scroll or move the page in anyway, the title of 'The Recipe Book' is clearly visible and below it is an easy to navigate selection of recipes for the user to see.

        - First Time Visitors, should be able to easily find the navigation links.

            Following the most commonly used layout for the navigation bar, users are able to find the navigation links to work their way around the site in the top right-hand corner of the page. The labels for navigation link are clean and easy to understand and read. For a user not logged into the site, the only dropdown menu within the navigation bar is to display the recipes by different categories. This keeping the navigation menu simple and minimal.

        - First Time Visitors, should be able to interact with the site upon landing on the site.

            When visiting the site, the recipes that have been uploaded to the site are presented to the user on the initial landing area. 
            Users can see a photo of the recipe, see the title of the recipe, see a quick summary of what kind of recipe it is followed by a large button that they can click to open the recipe to find out what the ingredients are and how to cook it.

            <img src="readme-images/testing-ftu3.png" alt="recipe cards on the homepage" width="80%">

        - First time users should be able to view the recipes on the site without having to log in or register for an account.

            The homepage that the users are taken to displays all the recipes that have been uploaded to the site. User do not have to register or be logged in to browse, search, categorize or open the recipes.

        - First time users are likely to be un-registered users and must have restricted access to certain areas of the site.

            To maintain restricted access to elements of the site, the navigation bar has links that will not display unless the user has a certain account level.
            e.g. a standard user will have an additional option to 'add a recipe' within the navigation bar, however the option to 'manage categories' will not be visible to them as this requires an administrative level of access.

            To prevent users navigating to restricted sites using direct url's, each restricted page has a function that validates the user's access level before displaying the site. If the user has the correct access rights, the page displays as normal, if they do not have the necessary user access level then the page will display a message making them aware of this.

            <img src="readme-images/testing-ftu5.png" alt="user must login to visit this page demo" width="80%">

        - First time users can navigate the site without registering. However, in order to submit a recipe to the site, users must register and therefore the user must be able to locate the Register link on the homepage easily and quickly.

            A first-time user to the site will be able to experience the basic functions of the site. The basic navigation menu has minimal links of which the login and register links are part of. The user can find and register with the site by clicking the link and they are taken to a short form and can be logged into the site with ease.

            The user will also be reminded with the options to login should they navigate to a part of the site that they do not have an account.

    * <b>Returning Visitor Goals</b>

        - A returning visitor would typically be a user that has already registered with the website, therefore the user should be able to locate the log in link easily and quickly on the homepage.

            A returning visitor can quickly log in to the page using the log in button on the navigation bar.
            This will take them to a page to enter and submit their login information.

        - A returning visitor should be able to make changes to any recipes they have uploaded onto the site but must not be able to edit or remove entries entered by the site admin or other users.

            When the user logs into the site, they are taken to a page that shows all the recipes that they have uploaded to the site.
            This page ONLY displays the recipes they have uploaded and provided that the session username matches the username in the database attached to the recipe, it will display the options to edit or delete the recipe.

            <img src="readme-images/testing-rv3.png" alt="user's uploaded recipes page" width="80%">

    * <b>Website Administrator Goals</b>

        - The website administrator must be able to find the administrator tools when logged into the site.

            When a user is logged into the site with administrator privileges, the navigation bar displays additional links that are options only available to an administrator.
            The tools that the administrator requires in order to manage the site are listed within the dropdown link 'Manage Site' shown on the navigation bar.

            <img src="readme-images/testing-wag1.png" alt="administrator navigation bar" width="80%">


        - The website administrator must be able to create, remove, update and delete recipe categories.

            The administrator can click on 'Manage Categories' under the 'Manage Site' tab on the navigation bar, where they can then see a list of categories currently listed on the site. Beside each category is the choice edit or delete the category, or at the bottom of the list there is a button to add a new category to the list.

            <img src="readme-images/testing-wag2.png" alt="administrator manage categories" width="80%">

        - The website administrators must be the only users to have access to the restricted websites and non-administrators must not be able to access restricted sites by direct URL inputs.

            Each administrator only sites have code to make sure the page administrator is logged in before displaying the chosen page.
            If user logged into the site is the administrator, they will be presented with a message explaining that administrator rights are required to access this page followed by the option to login with an administrator account.
            Should the user be logged in with the administrator account the page will load with the restricted content.

            <img src="readme-images/testing-wag3.png" alt="please login as administrator page" width="80%">

* ### <span id="testing-problems-during-development"><b>Problems During Development</b></span>

    -   When using the search function to search for recipes, entering a blank search would return an error, therefore I had to include an IF statement that would display the main page with all recipes if the user was to search a blank field.

    -   Accessing the get_categories (without being logged in) using a direct URL would open an error page. The reason for this was because the function had a conflicting function within the page template itself. Once I removed one of the functions, it operated correctly.

<br>

* ### <span id="testing-bugs"><b>Known Bugs</b></span>

    -   The recipe pages submit the instructions and ingredients to the database as a list array. These submit correctly and display as they should within the mongodb databases.
        However, on some occasions only 1 of each instruction/ingredient is returned to be displayed on the page. 

        I have read through the code for both submitting and returning the information and made some minor alterations to ensure this information is passed, stored and returned correctly. Since carrying out these changes and running some tests that I feel would repeat the problem, I've not yet had the bug re-appear. 
        It is possible that the tests I have carried out are not the tests that are responsible for this, however I will continue to monitor the site and carry out any necessary changes in the future.

## <span id="deployment"><b>Deployment</b></span>

* ### <span id="deployment-heroku"><b>Deployment With Heroku</b></span>

    I deployed my site to Heroku at the beginning of the project. I think it was important to have the page deployed from the start so that I could progressively test the site as I was developing it.

    Heroku has the option to enable maintenance mode that will hide the published site should there be the need to restrict the access at any point.

    To deploy the site, here is what I did:

    - To deploy to Heroku you need to have an account with them. There is a free tier account available and signing up is quick and easy at [https://signup.heroku.com/](https://signup.heroku.com/)

    - Once you have signed up and logged in, you are presented with the Heroku Dashboard.

    - Click <b>'Create App'</b> and you are then taken to the next page which asks you for the name of the app you wish to create and choose your region.
        (The app name must be unique and not contain spaces) Once I created the name and chose the reason I clicked 'create app'

    - Once it was created, I returned to my Gitpod environment for the app and opened up a new terminal session to install Heroku into the environment.

        In terminal I entered:

                npm install -g heroku

    - In order to deploy the site to Heroku, it needs to have requirements.txt file. A requirements.txt file contains a list of all the dependencies the project needs to return successfully. Heroku also uses this file to determine the language of the project. To create this file, I entered the following command in terminal:

                pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

    This will then generate a file within the project that contains a list of all the dependencies.

    <img src="readme-images/deployment-heroku-requirements.png" alt="requirements.txt file example" width="80%">

    - Now a Procfile needs to be generated to be pushed to Heroku, to do this I entered the following in terminal:

                echo web: python app.py > Procfile

    This will generate a file labelled Procfile to the project that tells Heroku which file to load to run the app.

    <img src="readme-images/deployment-heroku-procfile.png" alt="procfile file example" width="80%">

    - I then needed to link my git repository to Heroku. Firstly I went to Heroku and opened the settings tab for my app. Within this tab is a Heroku git url.

    <img src="readme-images/deployment-heroku-url.png" alt="deployment to heroku settings page" width="80%">

    - I then copied the Heroku git url and entered the following code into the Gitpod terminal along with a suitable name and the copied url:

                git remote add <<name for the remote here followed by the url from Heroku>>

    - I then pushed the initial files to Heroku using the following command:

                git add -A
                git commit -m "Initial Heroku Push"
                git push -u heroku master

    - Heroku will now accept this push and acknowledge the language of the application and install all the requirements to build the app. The app is now published on Heroku but does not have all the information it needs to operate correctly. 

    - I then generated a file named ***env.py*** to store the environment variables for the app. Here is how the file should look:

    <img src="readme-images/deployment-heroku-env.png" alt="env.py file example" width="80%">

    - Within the env.py file, the secret key should contain the secret key that is unique to the project. As this file contains information that should not be published and available to displayed publicly, I added this file to the ***.gitignore*** file.

    - To add the environment variables to Heroku, I logged into Heroku and within the dashboard click 'Deploy' and locate 'Deployment Method' and choose 'Github'.
    - In the search bar, locate the repository and click 'Connect'
    - Click the 'Settings' tab and locate 'Config Vars' followed by 'Reveal Config Vars'
    - Within these fields I entered the following information for my application: (these values must match the values within the env.py file.)

        |Key|Value|
        |:-:|:-:|
        |IP|0.0.0.0|
        |PORT|5000|
        |SECRET_KEY| ***unique secret key***   |
        |MONGO_URI|	mongodb+srv://root:PASSWORD@myfirstcluster.dr4g1.mongodb.net/foodie?retryWrites=true&w=majority|
        |MONGO_DBNAME|foodie|

    - Return to the 'Deploy' tab and click 'Enable Automatic Deployment'
    - Click 'Manual Deploy' and choose the master branch and click 'Deploy Branch'
    - It make take a few minutes to build the app, once its complete you can click 'Open App' at the top of the page.
